\chapter{Overhaul Feature Featherweight Java}\label{chap:ffj}

\section{Syntax}
The Syntax of \gls{FFJ} is a straightforward \gls{FOP} extension of \gls{FJ}. Due to the lack
of space we do not present the formal definition \gls{FJ} nor \gls{FFJ}, but instead we follow
the same scheme of the \gls{FFJ} original definition in \cite{apel_feature_2008} and present
the modified rules from \gls{FFJ} to \gls{FFJ+} highlighted with \hlmod{shaded yellow boxes} 
and new rules highlighted by \hlnew{shaded purple boxes}. Also notice that the successor and 
the refinement relations were simply dropped for being unnecessary by now.

    \label{abstractsyntax}
\end{table}
%\end{center}


The syntax of \gls{FFJ+} constructs is given at \cref{abstractsyntax}. The metavariables
\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D} and \texttt{E} ranges over class names, \texttt{f} and \texttt{g} range over
field names; \texttt{m} ranges method name; \texttt{x} ranges over variable, \texttt{v} ranges over
values, \texttt{feat} ranges over feature names. We assume that the set of variables includes the special variable \texttt{this}, which
cannot be used as the name of an argument of a method.

We write \texttt{\=f} as a shorthand for a possible empty sequence \texttt{f\textsubscript1}, \dots, \texttt{f\textsubscript{n}} 
and similarly for \texttt{\=C}, \texttt{\=x}, \texttt{\=e}, etc. We abbreviate the operations on pairs of sequences
``\texttt{\=C~\=f}'' for ``\texttt{C\textsubscript1~f\textsubscript1},\dots, \texttt{C\textsubscript{n}~f\textsubscript{n}}''
and ``\texttt{this.\=f=\=f;}'' as a shorthand for 
``\texttt{this.\=f\textsubscript1=\=f\textsubscript1;} \dots, \texttt{this.\=f\textsubscript{n}=\=f\textsubscript{n};}''.
We write empty sequence as $\bullet$.


A class declaration \texttt{class\ C~extends~D\ \{\={C} \={f}; K \={M}\}} 
introduces a class \texttt{C} with superclass \texttt{D}. This class has fields \texttt{\=f}
of type \texttt{\=C}, a constructor \texttt{K} and methods \texttt{\=M}. The fields of the class \texttt{C}
is \texttt{\=f} added to the fields of its superclass \texttt{D}, all of them must have distinct names.
Methods, on the other hand, may override another superclass method with the same name.
Method override \gls{FFJ+} is basically method rewriting. 
Methods are uniquely identified by its name, i.e. overloading is not supported.

A class refinement \texttt{refines~class~C@feat~\{\={C}~\={f};~KD~\={M}~\={MR}\}}
introduces a refinement of the class \texttt{C} and belongs to the feature \texttt{feat}. 
This refinement contains the fields  \texttt{\=f} of type \texttt{\=C}, 
a constructor refinement \texttt{KR}, methods declarations \texttt{\=M} and method refinements $\overline{\texttt{MR}}$.
Like class declarations, the fields of a class refinement \texttt{R} are added to the fields of its predecessor, which
is explained in more detail in \Cref{subsec:lookup}.

Constructor declaration \texttt{C(\={C}~\={f})\{super(\={f}); this.\={f}=\={f};\}} and a constructor refinement 
\texttt{refines~C(\={E}~\={h}, \={C}~\={f}) \{original(\={f}); this.\={f}=\={f};\}} introduce a constructor 
for the class \texttt{C} with fields \texttt{\=f} of type \texttt{\=C}. The constructor declaration body is simply 
a list of assignment of the arguments with its correspondent field preceded by calling its superclass constructor with the correspondent arguments.
The constructor refinement only differs from constructor declaration that instead of calling the superclass constructor
it will call its predecessor constructor (denoted by \texttt{original}).

Method declaration \texttt{C~m~(\={C}~\={x})\ \{return~e;\}} and method refinement \texttt{refines C~m~(\={C}~\={x})\ \{return~e;\}} 
introduce a method \texttt{m} of return type \texttt{C} with arguments \texttt{\={C}~\={x}} and body \texttt{e}.
Method declarations can only appear inside a class declarations or refinement, whereas method refinement should only appear
inside a class refinement. There is such a distinction between method declaration and method refinement for allowing the type checker
to recognize the difference between method refinement and inadvertent overriding/replacement.

A class table \textsf{CT} is a mapping from class names \texttt{C} to class declarations \texttt{CD}.
A refinement table \textsf{RT} is a mapping from refinement name \texttt{C@feat} to refinement declarations.
An \gls{FFJ} program consists of a triple (\textsf{CT}, \textsf{RT}, \texttt{e}) of a class table, a refinement table
and an expression. Throughout the rest of the paper the \textsf{CT} and the RT are assumed to be always fixed to lighten the notation.

\section{Lookup Functions}\label{subsec:lookup}

In \gls{FFJ} as well as in \gls{FJ} types are classes and classes have a subclass relation defined by the syntax of class declaration.
To navigate this subclass relation in the \textsf{CT}, the auxiliary operator \texttt{<:} is given in \Cref{table:sub_pred}, this operator is 
the reflexive and transitive closure of the subclass relation.

The \textsf{CT} is expected to satisfy some sanity conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textsf{CT}~(\texttt{C}) = \texttt{class C}$\ldots$ for every \texttt{C} $\in$ dom(\textsf{CT})
	\item \texttt{Object} $\notin$ dom(\textsf{CT})
	\item for every class name \texttt{C}~(except \texttt{Object}) appearing anywhere
		in \textsf{CT}, we have \texttt{C} $\in$ dom(\textsf{CT})
	\item there are no cycles in the subtype relation induced by \textsf{CT}, i.e., the
		relation \texttt{<:} is antisymmetric
\end{itemize}

\end{table}


In \gls{FFJ+} we fetch the refinement precedence via its position in the \textsf{RT}, i.e.
if a refinement of a class appears first in the \textsf{RT} it will be applied first. 
These functions to navigate the \textsf{RT} are all defined in \Cref{table:refinement}
    
First we have the function $class\_name$ which retrieves the name of a class refinement.

Next we define the function $refinements\_of~\texttt{C}$ to retrieve the refinements of 
a given class in the same order as they were introduced in the \textsf{RT}.

To navigate the precedence we define the \textit{pred} and the \textit{last} functions.
The \textit{pred} function will get a class refinement as an argument,
filter refinements of the same class of \texttt{R} as \texttt{\=R}, fetch the $index$ $n$ of \texttt{R} in \texttt{\=R} 
and return the element \texttt{P} at the position $n-1$ in \texttt{\=R} (denoted by the $get$ function). Notice that \textit{pred} is a partial function
because it is not defined if the a refinement is the first refinement.

The \textit{last} function retrieves the last refinement of a given class \texttt{C}.
This is needed because in \gls{FFJ+} we navigate the refinement chain backwards, from the last refinement
to the first, looking for a given method or field.

With this in hand we can define the actual lookup functions $fields$, $mtypes$ and $mbody$.
They are taken directly from \gls{FFJ} definition, with a new hypothesis and an extra rule.
The extra rule and hypothesis makes reference to dealing with the refinements. This is necessary
to make the proofs easier to maintain, since all we need to do is to provide a few acceptance lemmas
about these new lookup functions which we name $fields_R$, $mtype_R$ and $mbody_R$.

$fields_R$ simply retrieves the fields of all refinements up to that point in the refinement chain.

$mtype_R$ and $mbody_R$ tries to find the last introduction to a method, and retrieves its type or body.
These two definitions greatly differs from \gls{FFJ} to \gls{FFJ+}. In \gls{FFJ} $mtype$ would
retrieve the typing of the first method introduction, whereas in \gls{FFJ+} it will retrieve the
type of the last method refinement, and only later we define the rules for guarantying that the
refinement always has the same type of the method declaration. This was made to greatly simplify
the proof that states that if a method has $mtype$ then it also has a $mbody$, since both 
functions follows the same structure the proof is straightforward.

\label{table:classtyping}
\end{table}

Every class and refinement of a \gls{FFJ+} program is assumed to respect the well-formednes rules
defined in \Cref{table:classtyping}.
A well formed class have only well formed methods. And a well formed class refinement
only have well formed methods and well formed method refinements.
A well formed method and method refinement must has a closed expression \texttt{e} under 
the variables of the function parameters. \texttt{e} must a subtype of the return
type of the function. And if a function with the same name was declared before, 
it must have the same name. If a method refinement is declared in a method refinement,
this rule guarantess that it will override the superclass accordingly.

\section{Typing and Reduction}
The typing and computation rules for expressions are listed in \cref{exptyping,expcomput}
respectively. They are the same as \gls{FJ}. 
An environment $\Gamma$ is a finite mapping from variables to types, written $\bar{c}:\bar{C}$.
The typing judgment for expressions has the form $\Gamma \vdash e: C$, read ``in
the environment $\Gamma$, expression $e$ has type $C$''.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\def\arraystretch{3}
	\begin{tabular}{cr}
		$\Gamma \vdash x:\Gamma(x)$& (T-Var)\\

The reduction relation is of the form $e \rightarrow e'$, read ``expression
$e$ reduces to expression $e'$ in one step'', We write $\rightarrow *$ for the
reflexive and transitive closure of $\rightarrow$.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\def\arraystretch{3}
	\begin{tabular}{cr}
		\inferrule{fields~(C) = \bar{C} \bar{f}}
        {(new\ C(\bar{e})).f_i \rightarrow e_i} & (R-Field) \\

		\inferrule{mbody~(m, C) = \bar{x}.e_0}
        {(new\ C~(\bar{e})).m~(\bar{d}) \rightarrow[\bar{d}/\bar{x}, new\ C~(\bar{e})/this]e_0} & (R-Invk)\\
		\inferrule{C<:D}
        {(D)(new\ C~(\bar{e})) \rightarrow new\ C~(\bar{e})} & (R-Cast)\\
	\end{tabular}
    \quad
    \label{expcomput}
    \caption{Expression Computation}
\end{table}

There are three reduction rules, one for field access, one for method invocation, and one for casting.
We write $[\bar{d}=\bar{x}, e=y]e_0$ for
the result of replacing $x_1$ by $d_1$, $x_2$ by $d_2, \dots, x_n$ by $d_n$, and $y$ by $e$ in
the expression $e_0$.

With the absence of side effects, there is no need of stack
or heap for variable binding. 

In \Cref{table:eval-ctx} we define the evaluation context.
An evaluation context is to represent a term with a hole in it. This way
there exists a plug function that will insert a term in that context.
This makes easy the job to represent which kinds of expressions
are expected to be stuck and which are not in our progress theorem.
That being said, evaluation contexts roughly follows the same syntax as the syntax of
the expressions, taking the necessary care to preserve the order of evaluation
of the language. Since \gls{FJ} and \gls{FFJ+} are non-deterministic, no much
care is needed. 

Here our evaluation context denotes a reduction happening:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Right here", represented by $\square$;
    \item In the expression of a field access;
    \item In the object of a method invocation;
    \item In \emph{some} of the arguments of a method invocation;
    \item In the expression being cast;
    \item In \emph{some} of the arguments of an object creation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    $E$ ::= $\square$ | $E.f_i$ | $E.m(\bar{e})$ | $e.m(\bar{e_l}, E, \bar{e_r})$
    | $(C)~E$ | $new~C(\bar{e_l}, E, \bar{e_r})$

\section{Properties}
In this transition from \gls{FJ} to \gls{FFJ+} a few additional lemmas were needed.
They are only related to the lookup functions, since \gls{FFJ+} does not alter
the typing rules or the reduction rules. This means that the main safety theorems
presented by Igarashi et al \cite{igarashi_featherweight_2001} goes 
perfectly unchanged.

Below we list a few of the most important lemmas. The definition \gls{FFJ+}
was well thought so they are all straightforward. And finally the progress
and preservation theorems.

Only \cref{lemma:ref-type} is interesting enough for the complete proof.

These lemmas follows the idea of extending the original lemmas stated for
\gls{FJ} with the \gls{FFJ+} definitions, specially for the lookup functions.

\begin{lemma}[Typed method has body]\label{lemma:typed-method-body}
    If $mtype(m, C) = B \rightarrow \overline{B}$ \\
    then $\exists \bar{x}~\exists e$ such that
        $mbody(m, C) = \bar{x}. e$
\end{lemma}

Firstly, in \gls{FJ} we had \cref{lemma:typed-method-body}, 
which states that it is possible to
fetch the body of a function given the $mtype$ function. Since $mtype$ and
$mbody$ are symmetrical on their definition, this is straightforward.

Now it is needed to extend that lemma with $mtype_R$ and $mbody_R$, and since
they were also implemented to be symmetrical this is also straightforward.
However it is also necessary to prove its converse, i.e. $mbody_R$ implies
$mtype_R$ since it is used the negation of $mtype_R$ on the definitions.

\begin{lemma}[Typed method has body - Refinement]
    If $mtype_R(m, R) = \mathtt{B} \rightarrow \mathtt{Bs}$ \\
    then $\exists \bar{x}~\exists e$ such that
        $mbody_R(m, R) = \bar{x}. e$
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Body method has type - Refinement]
    If $mbody_R(m, R) = \bar{x} . e $ \\
    then $\exists \overline{B}~\exists B$ such that
        $mtype_R(m, R) = \mathtt{B} \rightarrow \mathtt{Bs}$
\end{lemma}

Next it is needed to show that method signatures respects the signatures
at the superclasses. Which is also straightforward by the definition of
$override$ and $override_R$. We provide the proof of \cref{lemma:ref-type} it 
is also necessary an inner induction on $override_R$.

\begin{lemma}[Subtype respects method types]
    If \cdecl{C}{D}{C}{f}{K}{M} \\
    then $mtype(m, C) = mtype(m, D)$        
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Refinement respects method types]\label{lemma:ref-type}
    If \cdecl{C}{D}{C}{f}{K}{M} \\
        then $\forall feat,~mtype_R(m, C@feat) = mtype(m, D)$        
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By induction on $mtype_R$. Let $mtype(m,D)=Ds~\rightarrow~D_0$ and
    $mtype_R(m,R)~=~Ds'~\rightarrow~D_0'$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Case $m$ is defined on the method declarations of $C@feat$, since $m$ declaration is well formed we have $override(m, D, Ds' \rightarrow D_0')$.
        \item Case $m$ is defined on the method refinements of $C@feat$,
            Since $C@feat$ is well formed we have $override_R(m, (C@feat), Ds \rightarrow D0)$,
            we proceed by induction on the structure of $override_R$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Case $C@feat$ is the first refinement we have $mtype(m, C) = mtype_R(m, C@feat)$, by well formed of method in a class (\cref{method-typing}) we have $override(m,~C,~Ds~'\rightarrow~D_0')$
            \item Case $C@feat$ has a predecessor $P$, and $P$ declares $m$
                by well formed of method in a refinement (\cref{method-typing}) we have $override(m, P, Ds' \rightarrow D_0')$
            \item Case $C@feat$ has a predecessor $P$ but $P$ does not declare $m$ the thesis follows trivially by the induction hypothesis.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Case $C@feat$ does not declare $m$ the thesis follows trivially by the induction hypothesis.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

The last two lemmas are about type checking the body of a function
given the return of $mtype$ or $mtype_R$ and $mbody$ or $mbody_R$.

\begin{lemma}[A1.4 - Method body is typable]
    If \mtype{m}{C} = $\bar{D} \rightarrow D$ \\
            and \mbody{m}{C} = $\bar{x}.e$,
            then $\exists C <: D, \exists C_0 <: D_0,~this: D, \bar{x}: \bar{D}\vdash e: C_0$
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Method body is typable - Refinement]
    If \mtyper{m}{C@feat} = $\bar{D} \rightarrow D$ \\
            and \mbodyr{m}{C@feat} = $\bar{x}.e$, 
            then $\exists C <: D, \exists C_0 <: D_0,~this: D, \bar{x}: \bar{D}\vdash e: C_0$
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Preservation]
    If $\Gamma \vdash e : C$ and $e \rightarrow e'$,
    then $\Gamma \vdash e': C'$ for some $C' <: C$.
\end{theorem}
For the proof refer to \cite{igarashi_featherweight_2001}.

\begin{theorem}[Progress]
    Suppose $e$ is closed, well-typed normal form.\\
    Then either (1) $e$ is a value, or (2) for some evaluation context $E$, we can
    express $e$ as $e = E[(C)(new D(\bar{e}))]$, with $D \nless: C$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
    Straightforward by induction on type derivation.
\end{proof}
